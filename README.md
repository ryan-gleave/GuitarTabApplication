# GuitarTabApplication

I came up with the idea of being able to make local changes to a tab quite a while ago and started developing this application as a prototype.

UltimateGuitar released the "Personal Tabs" feature shortly after this prototype was created (https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/ug_news/introducing_personal_tabs.html) so development of my tool was halted.

There are still a few features and optimizations that could still be made which I may implement as a learning experience and maybe even to improve the functionality offered by the UG website.

##TODO
* Save new local tabs after loading from the web
* Only save the tab differences as opposed to the whole tab content (?)
* UI Improvements
