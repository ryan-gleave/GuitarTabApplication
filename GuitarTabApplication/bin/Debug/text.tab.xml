[Intro]
(Guitar under violin riff)
D - Bm - A

[Verse 1]
D                
      My dewey-eyed Disney bride what has tried
                            Bm
swapping your blood with formaldehyde?
A
Monsters?

D
Whiskey-plied voices cried fratricide
                                   Bm  
Jesus don't you know that you coulda died, you shoulda died
         A
with the monsters what talk      E--2
                            D -  B--3   
monsters that walk the earth     G--2    (transition chord b/t verse/chorus)
                                 D--0
                                 A--4
                                 E--x

[Chorus]
          Bm      
she's got red lipstick
                     D
and a brown pair of shoes
              A
and she's got knee high socks
                Em
what to cover a bruise
             G
she's got an old death kit
           D
she's been meaning to use she's got
A                        Em
blood in her eyes in her eyes for you
          G        A                       D
she's got blood       in her eyes for you

[Verse 2]

certain fads, stripes and plaids, singles ads
                            Bm
run you hot and cold like a rheostat I mean a thermostat
       A
so you bite on a towel
                            D
hope it won't hurt too bad

Repeat 1st part of Verse 1 (my dewey eyed...)

[Chorus 2]
         Bm                           D
she says I like long walks and sci-fi movies
A                                   Em
you're six foot tall and east coast bred
G                        D
some lonely night we can get together
A                      Em
and I'm gonna tie your wrists with leather
    G            A              D
and drill a tiny hole into your head
              G            A                       D
oh, I'm gonna drill a tiny hooooooole... into your head

"Are you living or existing?"
